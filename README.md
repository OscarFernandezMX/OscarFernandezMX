### ¡Hola, soy Oscar 🚴!

<hr>


_They say that life is a lot like riding a bicycle — you must keep moving forward to keep your balance. My journey into the world of Artificial Intelligence is no different, akin to ascending a challenging mountain on a bike ⛰️._

- 📍 I'm an electrical engineer with a master's degree in Artificial Intelligence.
- 🌟 I'm interested in deep learning, data science, combinatorial optimization, and anything about artificial intelligence 😃.
- 🌱 I come from combinatorial optimization using genetic algorithms. Now, I'm expanding my knowledge by learning more about deep learning.
